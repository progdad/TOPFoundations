The most crucial css skills are positioning and layout!
This is where "The Box Model" enters the game.
It's called that way because each element is essentially 
a box, the shape of which is square or rectangular. 
And to be efficient and not frustrated in 
laying out and manipulating the boxes, the next styles ought to be mastered:
    "margin" - outer space/gap.
    "padding" - inner space/gap.
    "border" - the space between margin and padding.

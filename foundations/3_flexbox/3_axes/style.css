/* 
    This is one piece of code from ./index.html, 
    the styles of which are below,
    was an interesting task to tackle: 
        1. Break it onto a new line.
        2. Preserve "display: inline-block" state.
        3. Center it in relation to the parent block <p>.

    That's how I did it:

    text-align: center; 
}

code#fd-column {
    text-align: left; 
    padding: 10px 15px;

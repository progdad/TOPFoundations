    </div>

    <p>
        The most <b>confusing</b> thing about <b>flexbox</b> is that it 
        <b>can work either horizontally or vertically</b>, 
        and some rules change a bit depending on 
        which direction you are working with.
        <br>
        <br>
        The default direction for a flex container is horizontal, 
        or <code>row</code>, but you can change the direction to vertical, 
        or <code>column</code>. The direction can be specified in CSS like so:
        <span class="code">
            <code id="fd-column"> 
                .flex-container { <br>
                &nbsp flex-direction: column; <br>
                }
            </code>
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        One thing to note is that in this example, <code>flex-direction: column</code>
        would not work as expected if we used the shorthand <code>flex: 1</code>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The reason for this is that the flex shorthand expands <code>flex-basis</code> to <code>0</code>, 
        which means that all <code>flex-grow</code>ing and <code>flex-shrink</code>ing would begin 
        their calculations from <code>0</code>. Empty divs by default have 0 height, 
        so for our flex items to fill up the height of their container, 
        they don't actually need to have any height at all.
        <br>
        <br>
        The example above fixed this by specifying <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>, 
        telling the flex items to default to their given height.

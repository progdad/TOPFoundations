    <p class="note">
        <code>flex-shrink</code> is similar to <code>flex-grow</code>, 
        but sets the “shrink factor” of a flex item. 
        <code>flex-shrink</code> only ends up being applied 
        if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container. 
        For example, if our 3 divs from above had a width declaration 
        like: <code>width: 100px</code>, and <code>.flex-container</code> 
        was smaller than 300px, our divs would have to shrink to fit.

        The default shrink factor is <code>flex-shrink: 1</code>, 
        which means all items will shrink evenly. If you do not want an item 
        to shrink then you can specify <code>flex-shrink: 0;</code>. 
        You can also specify higher numbers to make 
        certain items shrink at a higher rate than normal.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        An important implication to notice here is that when you specify 
        <code>flex-grow</code> or <code>flex-shrink</code>, flex items 
        do not necessarily respect your given values for <code>width</code>. 
        In the above example, all 3 divs are given a width of 250px, 
        but when their parent is big enough, they grow to fill it. 
        Likewise, when the parent is too small, 
        the default behavior is for them to shrink to fit.

            <code>flex-grow</code> expects a single number as its value, 
            and that number is used as the flex-item's “growth factor”. 
            When we applied <code>flex: 1</code> to every div inside our container, 
            we were telling every div to grow the same amount. 
            The result of this is that every div ends up the exact same size. 
            If we instead add <code>flex: 2</code> to just one of the divs, 
            then that div would grow to 2x the size of the others.

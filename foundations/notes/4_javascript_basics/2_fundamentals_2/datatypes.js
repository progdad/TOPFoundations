// There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

// Seven primitive data types:
// "number" for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point(integers are limited by ±(2^53-1), which is roughly 9*10^12).
// "bigint" for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
// "string" for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
// "boolean" for true/false.
// "null" for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
// "undefined" for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
// "symbol" for unique identifiers.

// And one non-primitive data type:
// "object" for more complex data structures.



// The "typeof" operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.
 
// Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.
// Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
// For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
 
// In the next chapters, we’ll concentrate on primitive values and once we’re familiar with them, we’ll move on to objects.

By default, block-level elements are laid out in the block flow direction, 
which is based on the parent's writing mode (initial: horizontal-tb). 
Each element will appear on a new line below the last one, 
with each one separated by whatever margin that's been specified. 
In English, for example, (or any other horizontal, top to bottom 
writing mode) block-level elements are laid out vertically.

Inline elements behave differently. They don't appear on new lines; 
instead, they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or
wrapped) text content as long as there is space for them to do so
inside the width of the parent block-level element. If there isn't space,
then the overflowing content will move down to a new line.

Collapsing margins is only relevant in the vertical direction.

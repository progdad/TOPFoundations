    <h1>Oatmeal. My creation.</h1>

    <h3>Little description from me.</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout my whole life, I've been eating oatmeal.
        Saying it gently(very darn gently), I've never been a fan of it, but things do change in life, don't they)
        Not that long ago, a couple of lucky times during my childhood
        came to my mind when the oatmeal wasn't that much disgusting.
        And I decided to make what I recalled. The first several attempts were
        not very fortunate, but I'm stubborn as hell, so I didn't give up the idea
        of making perfect oatmeal because, indeed, in the case of success, I'd be eating a <strong>cheap, delicious, healthy</strong> meal, which is easy to make.
        So, this is the time to reveal the mystery. You be ready!
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <p>*And here we go*</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole-grain oatmeal</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Liquid honey(ideally the flower one)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's all. Enjoy!<br>
        Just kidding. You sure need some instructions. So...
    </p>

    <h3>How to cook it.</h3>
    <p> Boil some water. Pour oatmeal into a bowl, add enough salt, and
        add a couple of olive oil tablespoons to your blessing. 
        Then pour boiled water into the bowl so there is 1.5 times more water
        than the oatmeal. Put a plate onto the bowl
        so that the water steam is not wasted. Wait for 10 minutes. 
        Put off the plate and add honey - pretty much enough, too.
        Blend the ingredients. And now, finally, enjoy your meal.
        <strong>Esto es incre√≠ble!</strong>

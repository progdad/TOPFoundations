    <h1>Thai-style seafood with rice noodles</h1>
    <img src="./img/noodles.jpeg" alt="Thai rice noodles." width="600">

    <h3>Little description from me.</h2>
    <p>
        This is a recipe <a href="https://www.taste.com.au/recipes/thai-style-seafood-rice-noodles/e7366cb8-1c1d-4cd0-9aa9-e20f1a8d07a2">in the internet</a>. 
        But it seems to be pretty quick and easy to make.
        Not so healthy, according to the recipe publisher, 
        but anyway better and tastier than fast-cooked noodles, 
        made out of paper(in the best case).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thick rice noodles</strong>, of course.</li>
        <li>
            Whatever <strong>oil</strong> you have <strong>for frying</strong> stuff.
            The recipe owner advises with "canola oil", but who cares,
            I'll use olive oil, works just fine, too. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Curry paste</strong>. Yeah, it's getting interesting.</li>
        <li>Can coconut cream.</li>
        <li>Fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Lime/lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Seafood mix.</li>
        <li>Red capsicum.</li>
        <li>Onions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Well, I have no idea how I'm gonna cook it, 
        because most of this ingredients are impossible to buy at my place.
        But, as always, who cares. I'll cook it anyway.

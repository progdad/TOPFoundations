1. WORKING WITH TEXT.

<p> - for paragraphs. /
      creates 1 line indent between a new paragraph and a text above.

<h1> - <h6> - headings. /

<strong> - makes a text bold + emphasizing its importance. /
<em> - italic style + also emphasizing its importance. /
<b> and <i>. /
    These create bold and italic styles as well, 
    but unlike <strong> and <em> they do not emphasize text importance.

3.1. LINKS.

<a> - (anchor element) Creates links. /
      The element has an attribute "href"(hyperlink reference), 
      the value of which is a link.

*** There are two types of links: absolute and relative.
    * Absolute links are the links with a domain in the beginning.
    * Relative ones lead only to pages located on my website. 
      It searches for files from the current directory.


3.2. IMAGES.

<img> - Self-closing tag. Loads an image directly to a website.
        Must have the "src" and "alt" attributes, 
        first of which is the same as href for <a>, the second one stands for
        (alternative text) and is used to describe an image. 
        It will be used at the place of an image if the image cannot be loaded.
    
    - 4 main image formats:
        - JPG is great for usual pictures, doesn't allow transparency.
        - GIF is great for animations. Never use it for pictures.
        - PNG allows transparency, the same quality of an image 
            would weight way more than the same .jpg images.
        - SVG never loses its quality in any dimension, 
            because it's not made of pixels. Wonderful tool for responsive design.
